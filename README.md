# SearchButton

 A HTML tag definition of my search tag.

## Usage

It's very simple.

Example:

```html
<search type="baidu" content="12"></search>
```

It will show us a button. By clicking the button, a new tab will appear, and it will search 12 in Baidu Search Engine.

It also supports Bing, Yandex, Sogou, 360(S360) and GitHub.

## Special Thanks

Fgaoxing's Pandown-js gave me a flash of inspiration.
